Weekend Ray Tracer
==================

The weekend ray tracer implements the example given in the book
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html).

It is a simple ray tracer implemented in C++ writing a .ppm image to stdout with the results. The exercise is primarily
educational, though it also makes a good toy for playing with raytraced spheres.
